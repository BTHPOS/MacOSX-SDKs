.PP
Distance from the ray origin to the intersection point along the ray direction vector such that intersection = ray\&.origin + ray\&.direction * distance\&. Is negative if there is no intersection\&. If the intersection type is MPSIntersectionTypeAny, is a positive value for a hit or a negative value for a miss\&.

.PP
Index of the intersected primitive\&. Undefined if the ray does not intersect a primitive\&.
